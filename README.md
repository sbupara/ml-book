# A Practical Guide To Using Machine Learning in Marketing

## Introduction
In today's business landscape, the importance of data-driven decision-making has become increasingly apparent. As such, machine learning techniques have emerged as valuable tools in the realm of marketing analytics. Machine learning algorithms can help organizations uncover hidden patterns and insights within their data, leading to more effective marketing strategies and increased profitability.

However, the world of machine learning can seem daunting and complex to those without a technical background. This book aims to provide a practical guide to machine learning for marketing professionals, leveraging Jupyter Notebook and Python to take publicly available data and demonstrate how to apply machine learning techniques in practice.

The book will cover four essential machine learning techniques for marketing professionals: association rules, clustering analysis, numeric prediction, and classification rules. Each technique will be explained in detail, including its underlying principles, benefits, and potential use cases.

The book will also provide step-by-step instructions on how to implement each technique in Jupyter Notebook using Python. Readers will have access to fully functional code snippets, enabling them to apply the techniques to their own data and marketing scenarios.

Overall, this book will provide readers with the knowledge and skills needed to leverage machine learning techniques for marketing analytics. Whether you are a marketer, business owner, or data analyst, this book will provide practical insights and actionable guidance to help you take advantage of the power of machine learning in your marketing strategy.


## Tidy Data as a Concept and Prerequisite  
When it comes to working with data, one of the biggest challenges faced by marketers and data analysts is dealing with data sets that are inconsistently formatted and messy. These data sets can contain missing values, inconsistent column names, and other inconsistencies that can make it difficult to extract meaningful insights using machine learning algorithms.

To overcome these challenges, it is essential to transform these inconsistently formatted data sets programmatically into a standard, tidy format that can be easily analyzed using machine learning techniques. This process is commonly referred to as data wrangling or data munging.

The benefits of transforming data into a tidy format are numerous. First and foremost, tidy data makes it easier to visualize and explore the data, enabling analysts to quickly identify patterns and relationships that can inform marketing strategies. Tidy data also enables more effective machine learning modeling by reducing errors and simplifying the data preparation process.

Tidy data is a concept introduced by statistician Hadley Wickham in his 2014 paper "Tidy Data." In the paper, Wickham defines tidy data as follows:

"Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model, and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table."

In other words, a tidy data set has a consistent structure where each variable is represented by a separate column, each observation is a separate row, and each type of data unit is stored in a separate table. This structure makes it easy to filter, sort, and aggregate data, and enables efficient analysis using machine learning algorithms.

To transform a data set into a tidy format, it may be necessary to perform a number of data wrangling techniques, such as reshaping data, pivoting data, and merging data. These techniques can be performed programmatically using tools such as Python and Jupyter Notebook.

In summary, transforming data into a tidy format is an essential prerequisite for effective machine learning in marketing analytics. By following the principles of tidy data, marketers and data analysts can more easily extract meaningful insights from their data, and ultimately develop more effective marketing strategies.
